== Outcomes

By the end of day two, participants will have expanded their operational understanding of OpenShift and gained experience with advanced platform capabilities. The following learning outcomes are expected:

* **Manage Image Artifacts Inside and Outside of a Cluster**: +
Learn how to work with container images using internal OpenShift image registries as well as external registries, and understand how image policies impact builds and deployments.

* **Configure Applications with Secrets and ConfigMaps**: +
Use Kubernetes-native resources to securely manage application configuration, environment variables, and sensitive data without hardcoding values.

* **Track Metrics and Logging of User Workloads**: +
Explore observability tools available in OpenShift to view pod-level logs, inspect metrics, and monitor application health using the built-in dashboard and command-line utilities.

* **Scale Applications with Horizontal Pod Autoscalers**: +
Configure and observe autoscaling behavior based on CPU utilization or custom metrics to meet changing demand automatically.

* **Debug Applications with Built-In Tools**: +
Leverage OpenShift’s built-in debugging capabilities—such as remote shell access, live container inspection, and diagnostic events—to troubleshoot issues effectively.

* **Understand the Different Workload Options for Applications**: +
Distinguish between Deployments, DaemonSets, StatefulSets, Jobs, and CronJobs, and know when to use each based on workload behavior and lifecycle needs.
