Welcome to the OpenShift Application Development Workshop!

Over the next two days, we’ll dive deep into building, deploying, and managing applications on OpenShift. Whether you're new to OpenShift or looking to sharpen your skills, this workshop will provide hands-on experience and practical knowledge that you can apply right away.

=== Workshop Goals
1. Understand the fundamentals of OpenShift and its core components.
2. Learn how to develop, containerize, and deploy applications efficiently.
3. Explore best practices for application scaling.
4. Gain hands-on experience with troubleshooting and maintaining applications in an OpenShift environment.

=== Workshop Environment

To facilitate hands-on learning, this workshop provides the following tools:

* A Terminal for CLI Testing:: Direct access to the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI) for efficient management and control of your applications.
