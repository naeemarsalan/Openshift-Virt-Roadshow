= Command Line Interface and Web Console

Now that we've dispensed with the basics, it's time to start practical hands-on exploration of OpenShift. As we've already discussed and demonstrated, the two major methods for a user to interact with an OpenShift environment is through the `Web Console` or the `oc` cli.

== Setup

=== Web Console

.If you have an OpenShift cluster, then you likely already have the console available. The standard address location for the console follows this format:
* `https://` <~ the web console is secured with TLS
* `console-openshift-console` <~ "console" is the name of the workload and "openshift-console" is the name of the project in which it exists
* `.apps` <~ is the standard endpoint that all `route` based traffic is exposed
* `."CLUSTER_NAME"` <~ remember this for when you track multiple OpenShift environments
* `."BASE_DOMAIN"` <~ set at install time

.Confirm the web console is healthy like so:
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
curl https://console-openshift-console.apps."CLUSTER_NAME"."BASE_DOMAIN"/health
----

=== Command Line Client

The `oc` cli requires a little more effort to setup, but nothing extraordinary.

You can find the appropriate CLI on a running cluster using the web console:

.Download the CLI from the Console

Or you can download with using well defined URL endpoints:

.Local Cluster
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
curl -L https://downloads-openshift-console.apps."CLUSTER_NAME"."BASE_DOMAIN"/"ARCHITECTURE"/"OPERATING_SYSTEM"/oc.tar | tar -xvf -
----

.Public Artifact Store
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
curl -L https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/"ARCHITECTURE"/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-client-linux-"RELEASE_VERSION".tar.gz | tar -zxvf - 
----

== Locating Resources

=== Web Console

The design of the console is intuitive, but here are some of the primary areas of interest:

.Administrator Console Basics
image::administrator-basics.png[]
. `Role Dropdown`: Navigate between Administration and Development
. `Red Hat Applications Selector`: Additional Red Hat applications such as *Cluster Manager* and *Hybrid Cloud Console* can be accessed here
. `Quick Import Options`: Quickly add new resources to OpenShift with yaml files, git repositories, or container images
. `References and Artifacts`: Links to CLI downloads, versioned documentation, and guided quickstart tutorials
. `User Configuration`: Manage the current user context and generate new time bound cli credentials

.Developer Console Basics
image::developer-basics.png[]
. `Quick Add`: Add new applications from a variety of sources (containers, registries, templates, helm, object storage, etc) 
. `Topology View`: View the relationship of applications within a project
. `Application Panel`: High level view of resource information including replicas, configuration, services, and routes

=== Command Line Client

Accessing resources from the cli is simpler, but less pleasant on the eyes. Locating and exploring resources will mostly involve one of the following two commands:

.Get (view in native api format)
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get "RESOURCE_TYPE" "RESOURCE_NAME" (-l|-o|-n|-A|...)
# -l: filter by labels
# -o: results format
# -n: scoped to a namespace
# -A: include all namespaces
----

.Describe (view in human-friendly format)
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc describe "RESOURCE_TYPE" "RESOURCE_NAME" 
----

== Building Resources

=== Web Console

The console can be used to simplify the process of constructing resources for OpenShift. 

As a gentle introduction, OpenShift provides `forms` for several resource types.

.Form View
image::form-view.png[]
. `Populated Fields`: Reduce the available field options to valid resources
. `Freeform Field`: Allow for generic string input (either required or optional)
. `Increment with Units`: Scalable numeric input with orders of magnitude
. `Toggles/Checkboxes`: Hide irrelevant config behind enabled/disabled markers
. `Radio Selection`: Select from a predefined static set

For more in depth customization there are several tools built into embeded resource editor

.Editor View
image::editor-view.png[]
. `Editor`: Modify yaml with schema assisted tab complete 
. `YAML`: View and edit the stored configuration for this resource. (Available for all resources)
. `Schema Sidebar`: Explore the resource schema to identify available keys, values, and their associated types

=== Command Line Client

Unfortunately the cli does not provide as many user experience benefits. Creating and modifying resources is nearly identical to upstream Kubernetes in these are the most relevant commands:

.Create / Apply (submit files previously created/modified in your IDE of choice)
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc create/apply -f {$FILENAME} 
----

.Edit (modify existing cluster resources using the default host IDE)
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc edit "RESOURCE_TYPE" "RESOURCE_NAME" 
----

.Patch (modify existing cluster resources, but without opening an IDE)
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc patch "RESOURCE_TYPE" "RESOURCE_NAME" (-p|--patch-file|--type|...)
# -p: apply an inline patch definition
# --patch-file: apply a patch defined in a file
# --type: leverage json, merge, or strategic patch strategies
----

== Contexts and Clusters

Our final concern involves operations across multiple tenants and multiple clusters. Any given OpenShift user could manage several applications across several projects that are deployed across several clusters. 

=== Web Console

.In this scenario, the console does not provide much additional assistance. Your options are limited to:
* logging in/out to switch users
* opening a browser or browser tab for each cluster's independent console
* leveraging the "Advanced Cluster Management" console plugin to manipulate resources across multiple clusters at once

[NOTE]
====
`https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.13/[Advanced Cluster Management (ACM)]` is an advanced topic that is beyond the scope of this workshop. There is an excellent workshop https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaR6Rq6Z4IqcKOKT4c0uGkBt3YSRQ9S5v&si=42s9-av-gtOHID3r[here] for those interested in learning about ACM.

=== Command Line Client

Unlike the console, the cli provides several user mechanisms to quickly switch between projects and clusters. In order to understand how the CLI provides this functionality, let's breakdown the terms `Context` and `Cluster`.

.A `Context` is a combination of three things:
* User: Can be a service account or a user provided by an external identity provider
* Namespace/Project: Interchangeable in this context
* Cluster: An api endpoint in the form `https://api."CLUSTER"."DOMAIN":6443`

.You can see two example contexts in the following KUBECONFIG:
[source,yaml,role=execute]
----
include::example$config.yaml[]
----

A user could manually modify this file to switch between any number of contexts, but there are much quicker ways provided by the cli.

.Get [Users,Contexts,Clusters]
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc config get-users ...
oc config get-contexts ...
oc config get-clusters ...
----

.Set [Credentials,Contexts,Clusters]
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc config set-credentials ...
oc config set-contexts ...
oc config set-clusters ...
----

.Use [Context] (Changes "current-context" to "CONTEXT")
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc config use-context "CONTEXT"
----

[NOTE]
====
There is an asymmetry between the "get" and "set" methods for users. +
This design implies that the KUBECONFIG, and by extension the cluster, doesn't natively handle users.
