== Outcomes

By the end of Day One, participants will be equipped with foundational knowledge and hands-on experience working with OpenShift. The following learning outcomes are expected:

* **Understand the Components that Comprise OpenShift**:: Gain insight into the architecture of OpenShift, including its control plane, worker nodes, developer tools, and platform services.

* **Outline the Differences Between OpenShift and Kubernetes**:: Identify how OpenShift builds upon Kubernetes by adding developer-focused tools, enterprise features, and integrated services.

* **Interact with an OpenShift Cluster**:: Learn how to navigate and manage resources using both the OpenShift web console and the command-line interface (`oc`).

* **Manage Projects and Resources**:: Understand how to create and manage OpenShift *projects*, and how to organize, monitor, and maintain the resources within them.

* **Create Applications from Source Code**:: Use tools like Project Kaniko to securely build container images from source code inside a containerized environmentâ€”without requiring a Docker daemon.

* **Expose Applications with Customized Routing**:: Learn how to create and configure OpenShift *routes* to expose services externally, including options for custom domains and TLS settings.
