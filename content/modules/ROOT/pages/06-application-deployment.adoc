= Application Deployment

Now that we've established some "ground rules" on "fair behavior" in the platform we can start leveraging OpenShift as a platform for applications. This module will cover everything needed to take source code, build it, package it, and deploy it on OpenShift.

== Container Basics

Images are where our application journey begins. Without them, and the standards built around them, Kubernetes and OpenShift would be much different technologies if they even existed at all. In simplest terms, an image is a repeatable recipe for software wrapped into a well defined binary format. The format is has proven to be particularly flexible. Today there are images for several architectures (`arm`,`x86`,`mips`,`power8`,`mainframe`,...), several operating system families (`Windows` and `Linux`), and several operating systems (`rhel`,`ubuntu`,`suse`,...).

.Let's dig in to an example Dockerfile:
[source,dockerfile,role=execute]
----
include::example$example.dockerfile[]
----

Each (non-empty) line begins with a token in all caps that signifies a specific instruction when building:

* `FROM`: Are we starting from `SCRATCH` or are we building **FROM** another image?
* `WORKDIR`: In our new image, which **WORK**ing **DIR**ectory will be the context for further actions?
* `COPY`: What files do we need to **COPY** into our new images new working directory?
* `RUN`: What do we need to **RUN** in our image to acheive the correct configuration?
* `EXPOSE`: What ports are being **EXPOSE**d by our process?
* `USER`: What **USER** are we running the process as?
* `CMD`: What **C**o**M**man**D** are we running when this image is instantiated?

With the exception of `FROM` (beginning of file) and `CMD|ENTRYPOINT` (end of file), the specification allows near complete freedom on the order and amount of instructions. There are https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/[best practices] however. Apart from successfully executing an app, readability of the container file, the size of your container file, and the size of the resulting image should be highly prioritized. 

[TIP]
====
Starting off `FROM` the right image can help keeps images small and secure. +
Red Hat provides a family of based images called https://catalog.redhat.com/software/base-images["Universal Base Images"] to provide a solid foundation for your applications.
====

For the most part the use cases for these instructions are self-evident, but there are several that overlap and often cause confusion.

.Instruction Comparisons
|===
| Instructions | Explanation

| CMD vs RUN
| Both run commands, but at runtime and on build respectively

| CMD vs ENTRYPOINT
| Both the runtime process, but CMD is overrideable while ENTRYPOINT is not

| ADD vs COPY
| Both add files, but ADD should only be used for remote/packaged files

| ARG vs ENV
| Both control parameters, but at runtime and on build respectively

|===

And with all that behind us, we can start building images and creating containers. +
Grab your client of choice `podman` or `docker` (links below) and try the following commands: +

.Podman Image Commands
[%collapsible]
====
.Build,tag, and label the image
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
# From the source repository root
podman build --file src/cart/Dockerfile --tag cart:0.0.1 --label build-0.0.1
----

.Find the built image
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
# From anywhere
podman images --filter label=build-0.0.1
----

.Inspect the image
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
# From anywhere
podman inspect localhost/cart:0.0.1
----

.Create a container from the image
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
# From anywhere
podman run --name cart-0.0.1 -d -p 8080:8080 localhost/cart:0.0.1
----

.Test the image
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
# From anywhere
curl -I localhost:8080/carts/1
----

.Cleanup
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
# From anywhere
podman kill cart-0.0.1
podman rmi loclahost/cart:0.0.1

== Builds

Being able to build locally is a powerful asset, but what if you do not have the correct architecture or a powerful enough machine to handle builds on your own? There are several options provided either out of the box or as an addon.

=== Native Builds

OpenShift can build natively with the same `Dockerfile` strategy.
Assuming that the architecture of your own build environment is the same as your OpenShift nodes, we can effectively build the same artifact the same way as we did previously.

.Build Once
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc create build cart --strategy Docker --source-git=https://github.com/shpwrck/retail-store-sample-app --context-dir=./src/cart --dockerfile-path=. --to-image-stream cart:0.0.1
----

If you run the same command again, it will fail (by design). We need a generative way to produce builds repeatedly. That is where `BuildConfigs` come in. +
{empty} +

.OC Image Commands
[%collapsible]
====
.Build Repeatably 
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-build https://github.com/shpwrck/retail-store-sample-app --strategy docker --context-dir=./src/cart --to cart:0.0.1
----

.Trigger Build
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc start-build retail-store-sample-app
----

.Confirm Builds
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get builds
oc get is cart -o yaml
----
====

[NOTE]
====
We manually created the builds with the `oc start-build ...` command, but there's another option. We can trigger builds when webhooks or code changes are received. +

=== Builds with Shipwright

`Builds` and `BuildConfigs` have been around for a long time, and as such have less functionality than more modern approaches. Since their creation, projects such as `BuildKit`,`Buildpacks`, `Buildah`, and `Kaniko` have added interesting and useful new spins to the domain of cluster based builds. And while it's out of scope for this workshop, OpenShift can host a tool that takes the benefits of each technology and wraps them into a singular build platform. That tool is https://shipwright.io/[Shipwright] or https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.2[Builds for Red Hat OpenShift], and it is quickly becoming the common standard. 

== Workload Basics

The next step after accomplishing reliable/repeatable builds is deployment. We can generate the necessary images and we have a full understanding of how they operate. Transitioning to OpenShift from our local environment is a simple undertaking. Sometimes as easy as `oc new-app`! 

.Create a new build and a running 'Deployment'
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-app https://github.com/shpwrck/retail-store-sample-app --name test-cart --context-dir ./src/cart
----
or

.Create just a running 'Deployment'
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
# This command borrows the image from our previous builds
oc create deployment test-cart-deployment --image image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/default/test-cart:latest
----

These two commands do greatly oversimplify the capabilities that OpenShift has in regards to running workloads. +

.Take for instance:
* The many types of workloads `Deployments`, `StatefulSets`, `Daemonsets`, `Jobs`, `CronJobs`
* The `1,000+` keys and values that each resource has
* The `100+` Red Hat operator-based solutions that augment workload behaviors

It's important to approach this domain incrementally. So for now we will leave workloads behind and focus on one final application tool.

== Helm

Helm is the last remaining tool in our Application's MVP. Helm allows us to take what we've done up to this point. (Images, Builds, Deployments,...) and package it up just like we packaged our application itself. This affords us the same benefits that containerization did: reliable and repeatable results.

The process for taking what we have and packaging it with helm is more involved than our previous commands. But it can still be done in less than a few lines of execution.

.Basic Helm Steps
[%collapsible]
====
.Initialize a helm chart
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
# Create the file stucture for helm
helm create cart
----

.Remove Default Templates
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cd cart
rm -r templates/*
----

.Push the generate resources into the "templates" directory
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
# Add "-o yaml" to our previous "new-app" command and dump it to a file
oc new-app https://github.com/shpwrck/retail-store-sample-app --name test-cart --context-dir ./src/cart -o yaml > templates/resources.yaml
----

.Install Helm Chart
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
# From cart/
helm install helm-cart .
----

.Start Build
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc start-build test-cart
----
====

And voila! You can take that example and run it in any OpenShift Cluster! There are plenty more things to say about `helm` though.

.First and foremost, our MVP would ideally have the following improvements done upon it in the real world:
* Split the resources out of the `List` type, and into individual resources
* Add some parameters to allow for dynamic naming, scaling, or other resources
* Provide RBAC, Resource Limits, and Resource Requests
* Provide some additional documentation as to how the application should operate.
* Recreate meaningful tests

This list could honestly go on for several dozen more bullet points, but this is just an MVP (not **PRODUCTION**). After we've completed both "Day 1" and "Day 2", I highly recommend returning to helm, workloads, and builds to explore what was originally out of scope.

== Knowledge Check

*Digging around the source code repository, you may see Dockerfiles with multiple `FROM` instructions, what does this imply?*

.Answer
[%collapsible]
====
https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/[Multi-stage Builds!] +
Just as you can chain together `FROM` instructions from file to file, you can chain them inside a single file. This improves readability, consolidates the process of a full build, and helps keep image sizes small.
====

*If you `COPY` a directory, but you'd like to skip specific files, what recourse do you have?*

.Answer
[%collapsible]
====
Similar to a https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore["gitignore"], `podman` and `docker` both support a https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/context/#dockerignore-files["dockerignore"]
By specifying directories,files, and file-globs in this way, you can keep sensitive files out of images and reduce the overall size of the image.
